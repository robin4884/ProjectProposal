                <h3>about name:</h3>
                <li>"Otaku" is a term often used to describe someone deeply interested in anime, manga, and related subcultures. "Omnibus" suggests a collection or compilation, fitting for a site that tracks various media forms like anime, books, TV shows, and movies. Together, "Otaku Omnibus" implies a comprehensive collection or resource for enthusiasts of these media forms. Plus, it has a nice ring to it!</li>
                <h3>about logo/web mascot:</h3>
                <li>Omnibus is also used to describe a bus in japanese. In some contexts, especially in older or more formal language, it's used as another word for a bus, especially one that carries passengers along a regular route with multiple stops. Also "Omnibus" refers to a collection or compilation, while "Truck-kun" is a specific trope or collection/compilation involving characters getting hit by trucks in anime and manga.</li>
                <li>Our logo, "Truck-kun", is a playful meme in anime and manga communities that humorously refers to a recurring trope where a character, often the protagonist, is hit by a truck or a similar large vehicle. This event typically occurs suddenly and is used as a plot device to either kill off a character or to transport them to another world or dimension, setting the stage for a fantasy or isekai (another world) story.</li>
